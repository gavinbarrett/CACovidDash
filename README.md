## Description
This is a Covid-19 data dashboard for the state of California, USA. You are able to view data from all 58 counties. This data includes new cases by day, new deaths by day, total cases by day, and total deaths by day.

## Data Sources
Data is pulled daily from California's [Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/590188d5-8545-4c93-a9a0-e230f0db7290/resource/926fd08f-cc91-4828-af38-bd45de97f8c3/download/statewide_cases.csv).

## Graphical Demo
The application is currently being hosted on [Heroku](http://covid-data-ca.herokuapp.com) and might take a moment to respond if the server is sleeping.

The user will be able to navigate through the different counties in California and view their Covid case and death rates. Filtering data by zip code will be added as a feature in a future version.
